# ðŸŒŒ Taara - A Constellation Game

A simple browser-based **click-to-connect puzzle** where you form a constellation by linking only the correct star pairs.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Connect the stars in the correct pattern to complete the **constellation**.  
Each star has a **maximum number of allowed connections** based on its real position in the constellation.

---

## ðŸ•¹ How to Play
- **Click** one star, then another to draw a connection.
- You can **only** connect stars if the connection exists in the real constellation.
- The **number** below each star shows how many connections it has made out of the allowed total.
- Use the **Hint** button (or press `H`) to show the target constellation faintly.
- Use the **Reset** button (or press `R`) to clear all lines.

You win when all correct connections are made â€” the game will display  
`You formed GEMINI! âœ¨`.
